)Bubble Sort
    Bubble sort is the idea of repeatedly comparing pairs of adjacent elements and swapping 
    their positions if they exist in the wrong order.

    If we assume array A[] is an unsorted array of 'n' elements, the pseudo-code is as follows:

      void bubble_sort(int A[], int n) {
        int tmp;
        for(int k = 0; k < n-1; k++) {

                              /* 'n-k-1' being used to ignore comparisons from previous iterations 
                                int k is used to count and 'n-k-1' is used to stop from making a
                                comparison of that last items, as we can assume the last two items 
                                were properly swapped during either the last or initial iteration 
                              
                              
                              */
          for(int i = 0; i < n-k-1; i++) {
            if(A[ i ] > A[ i+1 ]) {
              tmp = A[ i ];
              a[ i ] = A[ i+1 ];
              a[ i+1 ] = temp
            }
          }
        }
      }

    Given an array [7, 4, 5, 2]:

          7 and 4 are swapped       7 and 5 are swapped       7 and 2 are swapped
                /  \                        /  \                         /  \
      Step 1 - [7, 4, 5, 2]     =>      [4, 7, 5, 2]      =>      [4, 5, 7, 2]      =>      [4, 5, 2, 7]


              No swap                5 and 2 are swapped 
                /  \                        /  \  
      Step 2 - [4, 5, 2, 7]     =>      [4, 5, 2, 7]      =>                        =>      [4, 2, 5, 7]


          2 and 4 are swapped 
                /  \ 
      Step 3 - [4, 2, 5, 7]     =>                        =>                        =>      [2, 4, 5, 7]


  *Time Complexity of bubble-sort method is O(n**2) in both worst and average cases, because the entire
       array needs to be iterated for for every element.


)Selection Sort
    Selection sort method iterates through the array with a single nested for-loop. For each index, it 
    iterates through the array, finds the minimum value and swaps it into the current index/slot.

    Ex:
      void selection_sort(int A[ ], int n) {
        int minimum, tmp;

        for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
          minimum = i;

          for(int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
            if(A[ j ] < A[ minimum ]) {
              minimum = j;
            }
          }

          tmp = A[ i ];
          A[ i ] = A[ minimum ];
          A[ minimum ] = tmp;
        }
      }

    Given an array [7, 5, 4, 2]:

          7 and 2 are swapped
                /       \            sorted       unsorted
      Step 1 - [7, 5, 4, 2]     =>      [2]       [5, 4, 7]

          5 and 4 are swapped  
                   / \               sorted       unsorted
      Step 2 - [2, 5, 4, 7]     =>      [2, 4]     [5, 7]
      
          No swap needed
                      / \            sorted       unsorted
      Step 3 - [2, 4, 5, 7]     =>      [2, 4, 5]    [7]     =>      [2, 4, 5, 7]
